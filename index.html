		<h3>About Me</h3>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p class="hobbiesP">Ever since I studied Graphic Design I really enjoyed the process of creating and redesigning elements. I love branding and layout design the most. I hope I can learn enough about CSS and HTML to be able to discover how to do all of those cool looking things I see on the web.</p>

<h3>Video Games</h3>
<p class="hobbiesP">I've always loved video games since I was little. I'm more of a fan of casual games and tend to stick with Nintendo games. Games have played a role in my life in terms of inspiration.</p>
